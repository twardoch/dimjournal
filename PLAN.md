# Project Plan

This document outlines the plan for improving the `dimjournal` project.

## Initial Goals (as per user request)

1.  Run `npx repomix -o ./llms.txt .` and analyze the entire codebase (`./llms.txt`).
2.  Re-read `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.
3.  Start implementing changes that lead to a well-functioning, elegant, efficient project.
4.  Record all changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
5.  Keep updating `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` to reflect progress.
6.  Keep documentation and build tooling in sync with the codebase.

## Execution Plan (Updated)

1.  **Create initial project documentation files:** (COMPLETED)
    *   Created `PLAN.md` (this file).
    *   Created `TODO.md`.
    *   Created `CHANGELOG.md`.
2.  **Refine `dimjournal.py`:** (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
    *   **Improve error handling:** Add more specific exception handling and logging. (COMPLETED)
    *   **Enhance configurability:** (Deferred for future work) Allow users to configure more parameters, like request timeouts, retry attempts, etc.
    *   **Modularize:** (Partially addressed) Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones. Some improvements made, further significant modularization deferred.
    *   **Improve code comments and docstrings:** (Partially addressed) Ensured all functions and classes are reasonably documented, primarily through improved logging and clearer code structure. Explicit detailed docstrings for all methods can be a future enhancement.
3.  **Update `README.md`:** (COMPLETED)
    *   Reflected changes made to the functionality or usage of the tool.
    *   Added a section on how to contribute to the project.
    *   Added Features, Disclaimer, Prerequisites.
4.  **Enhance build and CI/CD:** (COMPLETED)
    *   Reviewed `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, and `setup.py`.
    *   Updated `src/dimjournal/__init__.py` for Python 3.10+ `importlib.metadata`.
    *   Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include linting, use newer actions, and ensure Python version consistency.
5.  **Write/Update Tests:** (COMPLETED)
    *   Improved `tests/test_dimjournal.py` by adding comprehensive mocked unit tests for core classes and utility functions.
    *   Ensured good test coverage for the implemented logic.
6.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md`:** (COMPLETED) Documented all significant changes made.
7.  **Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`:** (COMPLETED) Reflected the completed tasks and identified future considerations.
8.  **Run pre-commit hooks and tests:** Ensure all checks pass. (PENDING - To be done before submission)
9.  **Submit the changes.** (PENDING)

## Future Considerations (Out of scope for this iteration)
*   Full configurability via CLI arguments (timeouts, retries, headless browser).
*   Extensive modularization of `dimjournal.py`.
*   Detailed docstrings for every public method/function.
*   More advanced testing scenarios (e.g., integration tests if feasible).
